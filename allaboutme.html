					<!--
					This is my biography where I am talking about myself and who I am. It also talks about some of the different places I have gone around the world.
					-->
					<p style= "text-align:left;">
				
						<h3 style="color:blue;"> Now, you must be wondering what I like to do and who I am? You must wondering who that Indian child is? Well, as you know, my name Vedant and
					 I am in grade 10. I am in the HMST (Honours, Mathematics, Science, and Technology) program at Northview Heights Secondary School. 
					 It is near Bathurst Street and Finch Avenue West. I was born in Dubai, U.A.E. to Rachana Shah (my mother) and Bhavesh Shah (my father). After living there
					 for approximately four years, my parents decided to move to Canada in the year 2005 and in August of 2005, we arrived at the Pearson International 
					 Airport. My mother's brother, who already settled down in Canada, came to pick us up. At first, I was a little bit relunctant to come because all my friends
					 and best friends were in Dubai and I missed them a lot; however, after some time, I started making new friends in Toronto and John became my best friend.
					 I liked to go to school and study as well as participate in extra-curricular activities, such as cricket, cross-country, and 
					 soccer. After graduating in grade 5 from Oakridge Junior Public School, I was heading to an iB (International Baccalaureate) school, Milne
					 Valley Middle School. It was a completely new journey for me because majority of my friends were going to Samuel Hearne Middle School, which was
					 close to Oakridge J.P.S. I started to enjoy the new experience and I made some new friends quickly. The same year, my sister was diagnosed with cancer
					 and due to that reason, my friend and I started to organize fundraisers to support SickKids Foundation. Over our three years at Milne Valley, we raised over
					 $800 from dodgeball games between students and teachers, candy sales, and selling flowers for Mothers' Day! At Milne Valley, I participated 
					 in many extra-curricular activities as well such as cricket, the Math Team, the band (music), and cross-country. For cricket, I was the captain
					 for grade 6 and grade 8, which was a big honour for me. Due to that, my leadership skills started to develop. 
					 Also, in grade 7-8, I ran for the grade 7-8 Representative for TDSB SuperCouncil for Area D and I was elected. It was a proud moment for me because 
					 this helped my leadership skills, interpersonal skills, and communication skills to become stronger so I can be a better leader.  </h3>

						 <h3 style="color:blue;"> Then, I came to Northview Heights Secondary School. The day I walked in the school, I knew this school was for me because the staff and principal
						 were very nice and helped us out whenever we needed their assistance. I learnt many things in my classes in grade 9 and they were amazing. I also 
						 made new friends, who were and are amazing. After grade 9 finished, my family and I went to Florida. That was the best trip I had because my parents and I 
						 enjoyed the experience we had. We ate a lot of Mexican food (it is the best cuisine in the world) and went to different places. While we were there, we 
						 went to:
						 
						 <ol style="color:#ff99cc;">
							<li class="center"> Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral </li>
							<li class="center"> Key West (known for their sea shells) </li>
							<li class="center"> All four kingdoms at DisneyLand </li>

							<li class="center"> Relatives Homes </li>
						</ol>

					<p>
						After the trip was over, I went to summer school to complete a course called Civics and Careers, which is mandatory in grade 10. Soon, summer school 
						came to an end and so did the summer vacation. It was time to head back to school. Grade 10 until now has been a great time and I hope it continues to be 
						like this until the end of the year and until the end of high school. Also, in high school, I have been part of many teams and have participated in several 
						extra-curricular activities, such as the cricket team, Math Club, Chess Club, Chess Team, FIRST Robotics at Northview Heights, and library volunteer. 
						
						In my family, there is mother (Rachana Shah), my father (Bhavesh Shah), and my late sister (Palak Shah). On my father's side, I have two aunts and two uncles, Bhavan and Jenis Vora, and Nihar and Zarna
						Tukharia. My father's parents are Jyoti (grandmother) and Pravin (grandfather) Shah. On my mother's side, I have one uncle and one aunt, Pratik (uncle) and Neha (aunt) Shah.
						My cousins are Nidhi and Karan and there are parents are Pratik and Neha. My mother's parents are Pushpa (grandmother) and late Navinbhai (grandfather). 
						My cousin from my father's side is Rohan (Bhavan and Jenis) and Dhruv (Nihar and Zarna).  </h3>
