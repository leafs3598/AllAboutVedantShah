						<h2 style="color:gold;"> Setting goals in life is something very important because it makes you work hard to achieve what you want in life. Similarly,
						I have set several goals in my life and I hope that I can achieve these goals sometime in my life. </h2>
						</p>
					
						<!--
							The list contains goals I have set for myself. Beside each goal, I have put reasons to why I want to fulfill my goals. 
						-->
						<h3 style="color:#1ac6ff;"> The following are the goals I have set for myself and why I want to accomplish them: </h3>
						<h3>
							<ul>
								<li style="color:red;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Get all marks in school above 85%.</b> I want to earn this because this will make my applications to universities easier and I could be quickly accepted to universities I want to get into.  </li><br/>
								<li style="color:green;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Start Model UN club in grade 11. </b> "Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches researching, public speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities" (Model United Nations). 
															 I want to start Model UN because it will develop my leadership skills. This is an asset to have when you enter the workforce because when you or your team are a given project at work, you can take the lead and start thinking how you will complete your task before the deadline. 
															 Model UN gives you an oppurtunity to develop communication skills, which is also important at a job. </li><br/>
								<li style="color:red;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Become the head of build team or president of the FIRST Robotics team at Northview Heights. </b> This is a very important goal for me because FIRST Robotics is a very prestigious compeitetion to take part in. It enhances your knowledge on science, mathematics, and technology.
															 My goal is to become the head of build team or president of the FIRST Robotics team at Northview Heights because I want to demonstrate my leadership skills. Also, there are many oppurtunities to earn scholarships, which is very useful in university. </li><br/>
								<li style="color:green;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Finish Northview Heights Secondary School and obtain OSSD. </b> Obtaining the Ontario Secondary School Diploma will help me graduate high school and enter university. It also demonstrates the work I have done in high school to earn the diploma. This is the one of the most important goals I have. </li><br/>
								<li style="color:red;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Get into university for engineering program. </b> University is something that is truly prominent because having an university diploma provides you with skills and advantage to obtain jobs. It also gives you a lot of knowledge, which is another reason why I want to go to university. The reason why I want to get into an engineering program in university because I have already decided a few different types of engineering I want to get to do in life.  </li><br/>
								<li style="color:green;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Complete Bachelors' and go to Masters. </b> Masters is a diploma everyone nowadays needs because of the competition in jobs. My goal is to earn my Masters after my Bachelors' because it will help me when I apply to jobs and could give me an advantage over other people. It also gives me a better pay and that allows me to do things I like, such as going on a vacation or buying a home. </li>
								<li style="color:red;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Buy a house for my family.  </b> My parents have worked very hard in their life and they continue to do so. They do so much for me and I want to give them something back in life and recognize the hardwork they have done in life. In my life, I want my parents to be the happiest people and I will work hard in life to do that. </li><br/>
								<li style="color:green;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Donate money to cancer research. </b> My sister, Palak, had died from cancer on my birthday which devastated me. I want to donate money to cancer research because I do not want children nor their families to go through the pain my family and my sister went through. I have already starting to accomplish this goal as I have raised money in middle school through fundraisers for SickKids Hospital, Toronto, Ontario. I hope to donate more money to cancer research as I grow older. </li><br/>
								<li style="color:red;"> <b style="color:pink;"> Sponsor a child in Africa. </b> I have seen many ads on the television for many years and it makes me upset seeing children malnourished and no scope for a better life. I hope to sponsor a child in Africa with my earned money as it would give me a sense of accomplishment that I have made an impact in a child's life. </li><br/>
								<!-- 
									I want to build house for children because to me, poverty is a very important issue. Governments need to abolish poverty and make their country a better
									place for everyone to live because that way, not many conflicts would occur and people would be able to have decent lives. 
								-->
				
								<li style="color:green;"><b style="color:pink;"> Build a school for children in poverty in India for free. </b> During my trip to India, I saw many children selling toys and other things on the streets instead of being at school. Without an education, they will be stuck on the streets and would not have a chance to become something in life. I want to set the school in India so children have an oppurtunity in life to do something and earn a living. </li><br/>
