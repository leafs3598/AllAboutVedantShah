												   Hello! My name is Vedant Shah. I am a 15 year-old boy and I attend Northview Heights Secondary School. I am currently in grade 10 and this website is all
												   about me. This website was made as this was an assignment in my ICS (Integrated Computer Science) class. It is also my first website so I hope all viewers enjoy biographies. 
												   To start of, I want to teach you about something I love: astronomy.

							<h3 style="color:blue;"><b style="color:green;" width="60%"> Astronomy </b> is something I have loved since I was 11 years-old. My admiration for astronomy began when my sister was diagnosed with cancer. 
																During her treatment, my family and I were planning to go to DisneyLand in Florida. However, unfortunately, the doctors did not give us permission to go because since 
																the cancer was behind Palak's ear, the noise of the plane would affect her ear drums. 
																However, after some time, the social worker that worked with us, Karen Fung, came to our house and asked me some questions, similar to an interview. 
																In the interview, she asked me questions about what I liked, disliked, and also, Karen asked me a question about what I want to be when I grow up. 
																"An aerospace engineer", was what I answered. It was a huge dream for me to accomplish and this is why I applied to Northview Heights Secondary School 
																for the HMST program. Soon, my parents got a call from Karen and said that my family was going to Pearson International Airport to meet pilots of an "Air Canada" plane. Then, my parents told me that we were going to the airport 
																because since we were not able to go to Disneyland and I wanted to be an aerospace engineer when I grow up, Karen organized a tour for us at Pearson International Airport. It was courtesy of Air Canada. After a few days, my 
																grandmother, my parents, Palak, and I went to the airport to meet the pilots. That day, I learned many things about the engine of the plane, what the altitude of the plane, and other fascinating features of the plane. We even 
																saw the place where the pilots and air hostesses take their breaks and where they sleep. It was extremely amazing learning about the plane, but Palak did not enjoy the tour as she was feeling uneasy. She was moody for the entire 
																trip and looked really tired, so we decided to go home after a few hours. 
																For me, though, it was the perfect experience to love aerospace engineering, astronomy, and dive deeper into the topic. It was an amazing experience
																for me and I loved it a lot. Even more, I got a pilot's hat from one of the pilots. Since that day, I have loved the field of aerospace and astronomy. 
																Sometime soon, I hope I will be able to buy a telescope to see the planets in our solar system and witness them first-hand. </h3>
